https://temp-3-923n.onrender.com/ is my link
this is the same project from a 3 except improved logic and in a nextjs setup with better formatting, basically
just take using demographic input and storing the data allowing for it to be edited
I had issues deploying to render(it should work now but it takes forever to open the initial submit page),
and also planned to used a bunch of components from a3 but never had the chance as it seems a lot of it is already done by nextauth
